## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

linux system is needed. git is reccommeded -for convinence. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

create a directory for the code. add a src sub directory. and convert the main directory to be your workspace.
then use git to get the code inside the src folder - or use the download option on github. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests / configuring

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### ROS package: my_topics

A topic is published by a script to a node and that topic is subscribed to by a script. There are three topics in this 


#### Getting started
launch the launch file.

#### Usage

send information via nodes

#### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

#### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
### ROS package: my_services

nodes request services from other nodes

#### Getting started

launch the launch file.

#### Usage

send information via nodes

#### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

#### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### ROS package: my_actions

sends action through nodes.

#### Getting started

launch the launch file.

#### Usage

send information via nodes

#### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

#### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
